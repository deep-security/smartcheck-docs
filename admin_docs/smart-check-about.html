<h1>About Deep Security Smart Check</h1>
<p>Deep Security™ Smart Check performs pre-runtime scans of Docker™ images to detect OS vulnerabilities and malware, enabling you to fix issues before they reach the orchestration environment (for example, Kubernetes®).</p>
<p>Deep Security Smart Check receives up-to-date threat data from private Trend Micro endpoints. Smart Check obtains malware information from the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network ™ and, for Windows images, detects threats using Trend Micro XGen™ machine learning algorithms. Deep Security Smart Check will find vulnerabilities in these Linux® distributions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Red Hat® Enterprise Linux</li>
  <li>CentOS™</li>
  <li>Oracle® Linux</li>
  <li>Ubuntu™</li>
  <li>Debian®</li>
  <li>Alpine™</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does Smart Check fit into a DevOps pipeline?</h2>
<p>Deep Security Smart Check provides a valuable step in your continuous integration (CI) or continuous delivery (CD) pipeline.</p>
<p>For example, Jenkins® projects can automatically build, test, and then push Docker images to a Docker registry. Once pushed, the image may be instantly available to run in an orchestration environment. If malware or vulnerabilities exist in the image, then they become a risk when the image is run. Since images are intended to be immutable, the right time to scan the image is when it's first pushed to the registry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Deep Security Smart Check fits in – it can scan Docker images in any registry that implements the Docker Registry API. All Deep Security Smart Check operations are available through a documented collection of APIs to simplify integration into your CI/CD pipeline. Deep Security Smart Check APIs can be invoked automatically by your CI/CD system to start scans when an image is pushed to a Docker registry. Scan results are also available through the API.</p>
<p>The Smart Check API includes a Webhook facility that allows CI/CD components to register to receive notifications of scan events, including &lsquo;scan-completed&rsquo;, allowing you to automate workflows. For example, a Docker image signing service could register to receive scan results and then use those results to decide whether a particular image should be digitally signed and promoted to a &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; repository that is available to your orchestration environment. You could also set a Webhook to call a receiver service that forwards scan results to a Slack channel or ServiceNow account.</p>
<p>Deep Security Smart Check also includes an administrator console that provides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a dashboard (system-wide summary of scan information, including metrics)</li>
  <li>view summary (including scan results and metrics for the view)</li>
  <li>user management</li>
  <li>registry and view configuration</li>
  <li>access to scan results</li>
  <li>scan history</li>
</ul>
<h2>Supported registries</h2>
<p>Deep Security Smart Check supports the scanning of Docker images in any registry that supports the Docker Registry V2 API. This initial release supports:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)</li>
  <li>Google Container Registry (GCR)</li>
  <li>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)</li>
</ul>
<p>To integrate Deep Security Smart Check into your pipeline, you will likely need to write integration logic to trigger scanning based on the event model of your registry. For example, Google Container Registry uses a pub/sub model to publish events about registry activity and Docker Trusted Registry uses a Webhook model.</p>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<p>This initial release of Deep Security Smart Check requires:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kubernetes 1.8.7</li>
  <li>Helm/Tiller 2.8.1</li>
  <li>Docker 17.06</li>
  <li>Google Chrome to access the Smart Check administrator console. Other modern browsers may work with Smart Check but are not officially supported.</li>
</ul>
