                The severity assigned to the vulnerability:

                * `defcon1`: is a `critical` problem which has been manually
                highlighted by the team. It requires immediate attention.

                * `critical`: a world-burning problem, exploitable for nearly
                all people in a default installation of Linux. Includes remote
                root privilege escalations, or massive data loss.

                * `high`: a real problem, exploitable for many people in a
                default installation. Includes serious remote denial of
                services, local root privilege escalations, or data loss.

                * `medium`: a real security problem, and is exploitable for many
                people. Includes network daemon denial of service attacks,
                cross-site scripting, and gaining user privileges. Updates
                should be made soon for this priority of issue.

                * `low`: a security problem, but is hard to exploit due to
                environment, requires a user-assisted attack, a small install
                base, or does very little damage. These tend to be included in
                security updates only when higher-priority issues require an
                upgrade, or if many low-priority issues have built up.

                * `negligible`: is technically a security problem, but is only
                theoretical in nature, requires a very special situation, has
                almost no install base, or does no real damage. These tend not
                to get backported from upstreams, and will likely not be
                included in security updates unless there is an easy fix and
                some other issue causes an update.
