<h1>Start a scan</h1>
<p>When Smart Check receives a request to scan a view, it pulls the image(s) specified in the view being scanned, unpacks each layer, and performs malware and vulnerability scans on the content.</p>
<p>There are several ways that a view scan can be triggered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Smart Check automatically starts a scan at midnight UTC for all views that have been created with the<strong> Scan on an ongoing basis</strong> option selected.</li>
  <li>You can manually start a scan by clicking the <strong>Scan Now</strong> button.</li>
  <li>You can start a scan through the Smart Check API. You can access the API documentation from the menu in the Smart Check admin console.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Manually start a scan</h2>
<ol>
  <li>On the Summary page or on the Views page, click the name of the view that you want to scan.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Scan Now</strong>.</li>
  <li>A confirmation message appears. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To confirm that scans are running, you can check the scan history page, available from the menu in the Smart Check admin console. Running scans have a spinning icon next to them.</p>
<h2>See scan results</h2>
<p>There are several ways to get scan results:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can add a Webhook through the Smart Check API with a destination URL that will be called automatically when results are ready. See the API docs for details. Your Webhook receiver could, for example, process the scan result and forward a notification to Slack or ServiceNow if appropriate.</li>
  <li>You can request the results directly through the Smart Check API. For details, refer to the API documentation, which is available from the menu in the Smart Check admin console.</li>
  <li>You can check the scan results in the Smart Check administrator console:
    <p>On the Summary page or the Views page, click the <strong>View</strong>. You&rsquo;ll see a summary that includes information about the latest scan, like the number of vulnerabilities and malware found.</p>
    <p>To see specific information about an individual image, click the image to display its scan history. Click a scan to display information about it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
