It requires immediate attention.\n* Critical: a world-burning problem, exploitable for nearly all people in a default installation of Linux. Includes remote root privilege escalations, or massive data loss.\n* High: a real problem, exploitable for many people in a default installation. Includes serious remote denial of services, local root privilege escalations, or data loss.\n* Medium: a real security problem, and is exploitable for many people. Includes network daemon denial of service attacks, cross-site scripting, and gaining user privileges. Updates should be made soon for this priority of issue.\n* Low: a security problem, but is hard to exploit due to environment, requires a user-assisted attack, a small install base, or does very little damage. These tend to be included in security updates only when higher-priority issues require an upgrade, or if many low-priority issues have built up.\n* Negligible: is technically a security problem, but is only theoretical in nature, requires a very special situation, has almost no install base, or does no real damage. These tend not to get backported from upstreams, and will likely not be included in security updates unless there is an easy fix and some other issue causes an update.\n"
